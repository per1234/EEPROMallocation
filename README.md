EEPROMallocation
==========

[Arduino](http://arduino.cc) library that makes it easy to automatically allocate unique EEPROM addresses for any variable type.

The concept for this library comes from the [EEPROMEx](https://github.com/thijse/Arduino-EEPROMEx) library. The Arduino EEPROM v2.0 library included with recent versions of the Arduino IDE now provides most of the functions of EEPROMEx except for address allocation.

#### Installation
- Download the most recent version of EEPROMallocation here: https://github.com/per1234/EEPROMallocation/archive/master.zip
- Using Arduino IDE 1.0.x:
  - **Sketch > Import Library... > Add Library... >** select the downloaded file(EEPROMallocation-master.zip) **> Open**
- Using Arduino IDE 1.5+:
  - **Sketch > Include Library > Add ZIP Library... >** select the downloaded file(EEPROMallocation-master.zip) **> Open**


<a id="usage"></a>
#### Usage
See **File > Examples > EEPROMallocation > EEPROMallocationExample** for demonstration of library usage.

##### `#include <EEPROMallocation.h>`
Allow the sketch to access the functions of the EEPROMallocation library.

##### `EEPROMallocation.setRange(startAddress[, endAddress])`
Set the range of EEPROM addresses that can be allocated.
- Parameter: **startAddress** - The first address of the EEPROM range available for allocation. The initial value is 0.
  - Type: unsigned int
- Parameter(optional): **endAddress** - The last address of the EEPROM range available for allocation. The default value is the last EEPROM address(if `E2END` is defined). The initial value is the last EEPROM address if `E2END` is defined or 511 otherwise.
  - Type: unsigned int
- Returns: `true` = success, `false` = invalid range
  - Type: boolean

##### `EEPROMallocation.getAddress([size])`
Get an available EEPROM address. EEPROMallocation will return the same address values every time the program is ran as long as the calls to `EEPROMallocation.getAddress()` are always in the same order.
- Parameter(optional): **size** - The number of bytes required. If size is 0 then this function will return an address with available bits. The default value is 1 byte.
  - Type: byte
- Returns: The allocated address or `-1` for no address available.
  - Type: int

##### `EEPROMallocation.getBit()`
Get the next available bit of the EEPROM address returned by `EEPROMallocation.getAddress(0)`.
- Returns: The allocated bit number.
  - Type: byte
